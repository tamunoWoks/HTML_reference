### CSS Basics
- **What is CSS?:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a markup language used to apply styles to HTML elements. CSS is used for colors, background images, layouts and more.
- **Basic Anatomy of a CSS Rule:** A CSS rule is made up of two main parts: a selector and a declaration block. A selector is a pattern used in CSS to identify and target specific HTML elements for styling. A declaration block applies a set of styles for a given selector or selectors.  
Here is the general syntax of a CSS rule:
```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```
