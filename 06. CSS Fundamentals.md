### CSS Basics
- **What is CSS?:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a markup language used to apply styles to HTML elements. CSS is used for colors, background images, layouts and more.
- **Basic Anatomy of a CSS Rule:** A CSS rule is made up of two main parts: a selector and a declaration block. A selector is a pattern used in CSS to identify and target specific HTML elements for styling. A declaration block applies a set of styles for a given selector or selectors.
 
Here is the general syntax of a CSS rule:
```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```
- **`meta name="viewport"` Element:** This `meta` element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling on different devices, particularly on mobile phones and tablets.
- **Default Browser Styles:** Each HTML element will have default browser styles applied to them. This usually includes items like default margins and paddings.

### Inline, Internal, and External CSS
- **Inline CSS:** These styles are written directly within an HTML element using the `style` attribute. Most of the time you will not be using inline CSS due to separation of concerns.
 
Here is an example of inline CSS:
```html
<p style="color: red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
```
- **Internal CSS:** These styles are written within the `<style>` tags inside the `head` section of an HTML document. This can be useful for creating short code examples, but usually you will not need be using internal CSS.
- **External CSS:** These styles are written in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML document using the `link` element in the `head` section. For most projects, you will use an external CSS file over internal or inline CSS.

### Working With the `width` and `height` Properties
- **`width` Property:** This property specifies the width of an element. If you do not specify a width, then the default is set to `auto`. This lets the browser determine the element's width based on its content, parent, and display type.
- **`min-width` Property:** This property specifies the minimum width for an element.
- **`max-width` Property:** This property specifies the maximum width for an element.
- **`height` Property:** This property specifies the height of an element. Similarly, the height is `auto` by default, which means it will adjust to the content inside.
- **`min-height` Property:** This property specifies the minimum height for an element.
- **`max-height` Property:** This property specifies the maximum height for an element.

### Different Types of CSS Combinators
- **Descendant Combinator:** This combinator is used to target elements that are descendants of a specified parent element. The following example will target all `li` items inside `ul` elements.
```html
<ul>
    <li>Example item one</li>
    <li>Example item two</li>
    <li>Example item three</li>
</ul>
```
```css
ul li {
    background-color: yellow;
}
```
- **Child Combinator (`>`):** This combinator is used to select elements that are direct children of a specified parent element. The following example will target all `p` elements that are direct children of the `container` class.
```html
<div class="container">
  <p>This will get styled.</p>

  <div>
    <p>This will not get styled.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
```css
.container > p {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}
```
- **Next-sibling Combinator (`+`):** This combinator selects an element that immediately follows a specified sibling element. The following example will select the paragraph element that immediately follows the `h2` element.
```html
<h2>I am a sub heading</h2>

<p>This paragraph element will get a red background.</p>
```
```css
h2 + p {
  background-color: red;
}
```
- **Subsequent-sibling Combinator (`~`):** This combinator selects all siblings of a specified element that come after it. The following example will style only the second paragraph element because it is the only one that is a sibling of the `ul` element and shares the same parent.
```html
<div class="container">
  <p>This will not get styled.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Example item one</li>
    <li>Example item two</li>
    <li>Example item three</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This will get styled.</p>
</div>
<p>This will not get styled.</p>
```
```css
ul ~ p {
  background-color: green;
}
```
### Inline, Block, and Inline-Block Level Elements
- **Inline Level Elements:** Inline elements only take up as much width as they need and do not start on a new line. These elements flow within the content, allowing text and other inline elements to appear alongside them. Common inline elements are `span`, `anchor`, and `img` elements.
- **Block Level Elements:** Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available to them by default, stretching across the width of their container. Some common block-level elements are `div`, `paragraph`, and `section` elements.
- **Inline-Block Level Elements:** You can set an element to `inline-block` by using the `display` property. These elements behave like inline elements but can have a `width` and `height` set like block-level elements.

### Margin and Padding
- **`margin` Property:** This property is used to apply space outside the element, between the element's border and the surrounding elements.
- **`padding` Property:** This property is used to apply space inside the element, between the content and its border.
- **`margin` Shorthand:** You can specify 1–4 values to set the margin sides. One value applies to all four sides; two values set `top` and `bottom`, then `right` and `left`; three values set `top`, horizontal (`right` and `left`), then `bottom`; four values set `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`.
