### CSS Basics
- **What is CSS?:** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a markup language used to apply styles to HTML elements. CSS is used for colors, background images, layouts and more.
- **Basic Anatomy of a CSS Rule:** A CSS rule is made up of two main parts: a selector and a declaration block. A selector is a pattern used in CSS to identify and target specific HTML elements for styling. A declaration block applies a set of styles for a given selector or selectors.
 
Here is the general syntax of a CSS rule:
```css
selector {
    property: value;
}
```
- **`meta name="viewport"` Element:** This `meta` element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling on different devices, particularly on mobile phones and tablets.
- **Default Browser Styles:** Each HTML element will have default browser styles applied to them. This usually includes items like default margins and paddings.

### Inline, Internal, and External CSS
- **Inline CSS:** These styles are written directly within an HTML element using the `style` attribute. Most of the time you will not be using inline CSS due to separation of concerns.
 
Here is an example of inline CSS:
```html
<p style="color: red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
```
- **Internal CSS:** These styles are written within the `<style>` tags inside the `head` section of an HTML document. This can be useful for creating short code examples, but usually you will not need be using internal CSS.
- **External CSS:** These styles are written in a separate CSS file and linked to the HTML document using the `link` element in the `head` section. For most projects, you will use an external CSS file over internal or inline CSS.

### Working With the `width` and `height` Properties
- **`width` Property:** This property specifies the width of an element. If you do not specify a width, then the default is set to `auto`. This lets the browser determine the element's width based on its content, parent, and display type.
