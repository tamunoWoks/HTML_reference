### Design Terminology
- **Layout:** This is how visual elements are arranged on a page or screen to communicate a message. These elements may include text, images, and white space.
- **Alignment:** This is how the elements are placed in relation to one another. Using alignment correctly is helpful for making the design look clean and organized.
- **Composition:** This is the act of arranging elements to create a harmonious design. It determines how elements like images, text, and shapes relate to each other and contribute to the design in an artistic way.
