## Semantic HTML
**Semantic HTML** means using HTML tags that convey meaning and structure to both browsers and developers, rather than just using generic containers. When you write semantic HTML, you choose elements that describe the meaning or purpose of the content, not just how it looks.

### Importance of Semantic HTML:
- **Structural hierarchy for heading elements:** It is important to use the correct heading element to maintain the structural hierarchy of the content. The `h1` element is the highest level of heading and the `h6` element is the lowest level of heading.
- **Presentational HTML elements:** Elements that define the appearance of content. Ex. the deprecated `center`, `big` and `font` elements.
- **Semantic HTML elements**: Elements that hold meaning and structure. Ex. `header`, `nav`, `figure`.

### Semantic HTML Elements:
- **Header element:** used to define the header of a document or section.
```html
<header>
  <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our cat gallery.</p>
</header>
```
- **Main element:** used to contain the main content of the web page.
```html
<main>
  <section>
    <h2>Cat Photos</h2>
    <p>Browse adorable cat pictures.</p>
  </section>
</main>
```
- **Section element:** used to divide up content into smaller sections.
```html
<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I am Jane Doe and I am a web developer.</p>
</section>
```
- **Navigation Section (`nav`) element:** represents a section with navigation links.
```html
<nav>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#photos">Photos</a></li>
    <li><a href="#videos">Videos</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```
- **Figure element:** used to contain illustrations and diagrams.
```html
<figure>
  <img
    src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg"
    alt="Two tabby kittens sleeping together on a couch."
  />
  <figcaption>Cats <strong>hate</strong> other cats.</figcaption>
</figure>
```
- **Emphasis (`em`) element:** marks text that has stress emphasis.
```html
<p>
  Never give up on <em>your</em> dreams.
</p>
```
- **Idiomatic Text (`i`) element:** used for highlighting alternative voice or mood, idiomatic terms from another language, technical terms, and thoughts.
```html
<p>
  There is a certain <i lang="fr">je ne sais quoi</i> in the air.
</p>
```
The `lang` attribute inside the open `i` tag is used to specify the language of the content. In this case, the language would be French. The `i` element does not indicate if the text is important or not, it only shows that it's somehow different from the surrounding text.
- **Strong Importance (`strong`) element:** marks text that has strong importance.
```html
<p>
  <strong>Warning:</strong> This product may cause allergic reactions.
</p>
```
- **Bring Attention To (`b`) element:** used to bring attention to text that is not important for the meaning of the content. It's commonly used to highlight keywords in summaries or product names in reviews.
```html
<p>
  We tested several products, including the <b>SuperSound 3000</b> for audio quality, the <b>QuickCharge Pro</b> for fast charging, and the <b>Ecoclean Vacuum</b> for cleaning. The first two performed well, but the <b>Ecoclean Vacuum</b> did not meet expectations.
</p>
```
- **Description List (`dl`) element:** used to represent a list of term-description groupings.
- **Description Term (`dt`) element:** used to represent the term being defined.
- **Description Details (`dd`) element:** used to represent the description of the term.
```html
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
</dl>
```
- **Block Quotation (`blockquote`) element:** used to represent a section that is quoted from another source. This element has a `cite` attribute. The value of the `cite` attribute is the URL of the source.
```html
<blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
  "Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? To have built software systems that people rely upon?"
</blockquote>
```
- **Citation (`cite`) element:** used to attribute the source of the referenced work visually. Marks up the title of the reference.
```html
<div>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
    "Can you imagine what it would be like to be a successful developer? To have built software systems that people rely upon?"
  </blockquote>

```
- **Inline Quotation (`q`) element:** used to represent a short inline quotation.
```html
<p>
  As Quincy Larson said,
  <q cite="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/">
    Momentum is everything.
  </q>
</p>
```
- **Abbreviation (`abbr`) element:** used to represent an abbreviation or acronym. To help users understand what the abbreviation or acronym is, you can show its full form, a human readable description, with the title attribute.

</p>
```
- **Contact Address (`address`) element:** used to represent the contact information.
- **(Date) Time (`time`) element:** used to represent a date and/or time. The `datetime` attribute is used to translate dates and times into a machine-readable format.

  The reservations are for the <time datetime="20:00">20:00 </time>
</p>
```
- **ISO 8601 Date (`datetime`) attribute:** used to represent dates and times in a machine-readable format. The standard format is `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss`, with the capital `T` being a separator between the date and time.
- **Superscript (`sup`) element:** used to represent superscript text. Common use cases for the sup element would include exponents, superior lettering and ordinal numbers.
