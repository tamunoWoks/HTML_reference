## Semantic HTML
**Semantic HTML** means using HTML tags that convey meaning and structure to both browsers and developers, rather than just using generic containers. When you write semantic HTML, you choose elements that describe the meaning or purpose of the content, not just how it looks.

### Importance of Semantic HTML:
- **Structural hierarchy for heading elements:** It is important to use the correct heading element to maintain the structural hierarchy of the content. The `h1` element is the highest level of heading and the `h6` element is the lowest level of heading.
- **Presentational HTML elements:** Elements that define the appearance of content. Ex. the deprecated `center`, `big` and `font` elements.
- **Semantic HTML elements**: Elements that hold meaning and structure. Ex. `header`, `nav`, `figure`.

### Semantic HTML Elements:
- **Header element:** used to define the header of a document or section.
```html
<header>
  <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our cat gallery.</p>
</header>
```
