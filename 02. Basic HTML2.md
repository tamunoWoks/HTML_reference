### Boilerplate and Encoding
#### HTML boilerplate: 
This is a template that includes the basic structure and essential elements every HTML document needs.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>freeCodeCamp</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <!--Headings, paragraphs, images, etc. go inside here-->
  </body>
</html>
```

- **`html` Element:** This represents the top level element or the root of an HTML document. To specify the language for the document, you should use the `lang` attribute.
- **`head` Element:** The `head` section contains important meta data which is behind-the-scenes information needed for browsers and search engines.
- **`meta` Elements:** These elements represent your site's metadata. These element have details about things like character encoding, and how websites like Twitter should preview your page's link and more.
