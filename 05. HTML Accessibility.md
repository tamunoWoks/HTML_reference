### Introduction to Accessibility
- **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines:** The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of guidelines for making web content more accessible to people with disabilities. The four principles of WCAG are POUR which stands for Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and Robust.

### Assistive Technology for Accessibility
- **Screen readers:** Software programs that read the content of a computer screen out loud. They are used by people who are blind or visually impaired to access the web.
- **Large text or braille keyboards:** Used by people with visual impairments to access the web.
- **Screen magnifiers:** Software programs that enlarge the content of a computer screen. They are used by people with low vision to access the web.
- **Alternative pointing devices:** Used by people with mobility impairments to access the web. This includes devices such as joysticks, trackballs, and touchpads.
- **Voice recognition:** Used by people with mobility impairments to access the web. It allows users to control a computer using their voice.

### Accessibility Auditing Tools
- **Common Accessibility Tools:** Google Lighthouse, Wave, IBM Equal Accessibility Checker, and axe DevTools are some of the common accessibility tools used to audit the accessibility of a website.

### Accessibility Best Practices
- **Proper heading level structure:** You should use proper heading levels to create a logical structure for your content. This helps people using assistive technologies understand the content of your website.
- **Accessibility and Tables:** When using tables, you should use the `th` element to define header cells and the `td` element to define data cells. This helps people using assistive technologies understand the structure of the table. With the `caption` element, you can write the caption (or title) of a table, so users, especially those who use assistive technologies, can quickly understand the table's purpose and content. You should place the `caption` element immediately after the opening tag of the `table` element. This way, screen readers and other assistive technologies can provide more context by announcing the caption before reading the content.
