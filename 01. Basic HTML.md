## HTML
**HTML** (_HyperText Markup Language_) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. In clear terms, HTML tells a web browser what content exists on a page and how that content is organized.

### HTML Basics:
- **Role of HTML:** HTML represents the content and structure of the web page.
- **HTML Elements:** Elements are the building blocks for an HTML document. They represent headings, paragraphs, links, images and more. Most HTML elements consist of an opening tag `(<elementName>` and a closing tag `</elementName>`.

Here is the basic syntax:
```html
<elementName>Content goes here</elementName>
```
