## HTML
**HTML** (_HyperText Markup Language_) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. In clear terms, HTML tells a web browser what content exists on a page and how that content is organized.

### HTML Basics:
- **Role of HTML:** HTML represents the content and structure of the web page.
- **HTML Elements:** Elements are the building blocks for an HTML document. They represent headings, paragraphs, links, images and more. Most HTML elements consist of an opening tag `<elementName>` and a closing tag `</elementName>`.

Here is the basic syntax:
```html
<p>This element represents a paragraph</p>
```
#### Void Elements: 
Void elements in HTML are elements that do not have closing tags and cannot contain any content. They consist of a single tag and are used to insert or represent something in the document rather than wrap content. Below are the most commonly used void elements:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
<br>
<hr>
<input type="text">
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```
It is common to see some codebases that include a forward slash (/) inside the void element. Both of these are acceptable:
```html
<img src="img.png">
<img src="img.png"/>
```
#### Attributes:
An attribute is a value placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element. Attributes provide additional information about the element or specify how the element should behave. Here is the basic syntax for an attribute:
```html
<tagname attribute="value">Content</tagname>
```
Example:
```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company logo">
```
- `src` specifies the image source.
- `alt` provides alternative text for accessibility.
#### Boolean Attributes:
A boolean attribute is an attribute that can either be present or absent in an HTML tag. They do not require a value as their presence alone activates them. If present, the value is true otherwise it is false. Examples of boolean attributes include `disabled`, `readonly`, and `required`. Examples:
```html
<input type="checkbox" checked>
<button disabled>Submit</button>
```
#### Comments: 
Comments are used in programming to leave notes for yourself and other developers in your code. Here is the syntax for a comment in HTML:
```html
<!--This is an HTML comment.-->
```

### Common HTML Elements
#### Headers: 
There are six heading elements in HTML. The `h1` through `h6` heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so `h2` elements have less importance than `h1` elements. For example:
```html
<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least important heading element</h6>
```
#### Paragraphs: 
This `p` element is used for paragraphs on a web page. For example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
```
#### Images:
The `img` element is used to add images to the web page. The `src` attribute is used to specify the location for that image. For image elements, it's good practice to include another attribute called the `alt` attribute. Here's an example of an `img` element with the `src` and `alt` attributes:
```html
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
```
#### Body:
The `body` element is used to represent the content for the HTML document.
```html
<body>
  <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
</body>
```
#### Section:
The `section` element is used to divide up content into smaller sections. For example:
```html
<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I am Jane Doe and I am a web developer.</p>
</section>
```
