## HTML
**HTML** (_HyperText Markup Language_) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. In clear terms, HTML tells a web browser what content exists on a page and how that content is organized.

### HTML Basics:
- **Role of HTML:** HTML represents the content and structure of the web page.
- **HTML Elements:** Elements are the building blocks for an HTML document. They represent headings, paragraphs, links, images and more. Most HTML elements consist of an opening tag `<elementName>` and a closing tag `</elementName>`.

Here is the basic syntax:
```html
<p>This element represents a paragraph</p>
```
#### Void Elements: 
Void elements in HTML are elements that do not have closing tags and cannot contain any content. They consist of a single tag and are used to insert or represent something in the document rather than wrap content. Below are the most commonly used void elements:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
<br>
<hr>
<input type="text">
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```
It is common to see some codebases that include a forward slash (/) inside the void element. Both of these are acceptable:
```html
<img src="img.png">
<img src="img.png"/>
```
#### Attributes:
An attribute is a value placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element. Attributes provide additional information about the element or specify how the element should behave. Here is the basic syntax for an attribute:
```html
<tagname attribute="value">Content</tagname>
```
Example:
```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company logo">
```
- `src` specifies the image source.
- `alt` provides alternative text for accessibility.
#### Boolean Attributes:
A boolean attribute is an attribute that can either be present or absent in an HTML tag. They do not require a value as their presence alone activates them. If present, the value is true otherwise it is false. Examples of boolean attributes include `disabled`, `readonly`, and `required`. Examples:
```html
<input type="checkbox" checked>
<button disabled>Submit</button>
```
#### Comments: 
Comments are used in programming to leave notes for yourself and other developers in your code. Here is the syntax for a comment in HTML:
```html
<!--This is an HTML comment.-->
```

### Common HTML Elements
#### Headers: 
There are six heading elements in HTML. The `h1` through `h6` heading elements are used to signify the importance of content below them. The lower the number, the higher the importance, so `h2` elements have less importance than `h1` elements. For example:
```html
<h1>most important heading element</h1>
<h2>second most important heading element</h2>
<h3>third most important heading element</h3>
<h4>fourth most important heading element</h4>
<h5>fifth most important heading element</h5>
<h6>least important heading element</h6>
```
#### Paragraphs: 
This `p` element is used for paragraphs on a web page. For example:
```html
<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
```
#### Images:
The `img` element is used to add images to the web page. The `src` attribute is used to specify the location for that image. For image elements, it's good practice to include another attribute called the `alt` attribute. Here's an example of an `img` element with the `src` and `alt` attributes:
```html
<img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/lasagna.jpg" alt="A slice of lasagna on a plate.">
```
#### Body:
The `body` element is used to represent the content for the HTML document.
```html
<body>
  <h1>CatPhotoApp</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
</body>
```
#### Section:
The `section` element is used to divide up content into smaller sections. For example:
```html
<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hi, I am Jane Doe and I am a web developer.</p>
</section>
```
#### Div:
The `div` element is a generic HTML element that does not hold any semantic meaning. It is used as a generic container to hold other HTML elements. For example:
```html
<div>
  <h1>I am a heading</h1>
  <p>I am a paragraph</p>
</div>
```
#### Anchor `a`: 
The `a` elements are used to apply links to a web page. The `href` attribute is used to specify where the link should go when the user clicks on it, and the `target` attribute specifies where a linked document will open when a user clicks the link. For example:
```html
<a href="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/running-cats.jpg" target="_blank>cute cats</a>
```
The common target values include:
- **`_self` (Default):** Opens the link in the same tab or window.
- **`_blank`:** Opens the link in a new tab or window.
- **`_parent`:** Opens the link in the parent frame. For example, if your website has an `iframe`, a `_parent` value in that `iframe` would open in your website's tab/window, not in the embedded frame.
- **`_top`:** Opens the link in the full browser window, breaking out of all frames. It opens the link in the top-most browsing context ("the parent of the parent"). This is similar to `_parent`, but the link will always open in the full browser tab/window, even for nested embedded frames.
- There is a fifth value, called **_unfencedTop**, which is currently used for the experimental `FencedFrame` API. You probably won't have a reason to use this one yet.

#### Lists:
To create a bulleted list of items you should use the `ul` element with one or more `li` elements nested inside like this:
```html
<ul>
  <li>catnip</li>
  <li>laser pointers</li>
  <li>lasagna</li>
</ul>
```
To create an ordered list of items you should use the `ol` element:
```html
<ol>
  <li>flea treatment</li>
  <li>thunder</li>
  <li>other cats</li>
</ol>
```
#### Text editing:
The emphasis `em` Element is used to italicize a piece of text. for example:
```html
<p>Cats <em>love</em> lasagna.</p>
```
While the `strong` element is used to place make a text bold, for example:
```html
<p>
  <strong>Important:</strong> Before proceeding, make sure to wear your safety goggles. 
</p>
```
#### Figure:
The `figure` element is used to group content like images and diagrams. The `figcaption` element is used to represent a caption for that content inside the figure element. For example:
```html
<figure>
  <img src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/cats.jpg" alt="Two tabby kittens sleeping together on a couch.">
  <figcaption>Cats <strong>hate</strong> other cats.</figcaption>  
</figure>
```
#### Main & Footer:
- **`main` Element:** This element is used to represent the main content for a web page.
- **`footer` Element:** This element is placed at the bottom of the HTML document and usually contains copyright information and other important page links. For example:
```html
<main>
  <p>
    This is is just another reference
  </p>
</main>

<footer>
  <p>
    No Copyright - <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org">freeCodeCamp.org</a>
  </p>
</footer>
```
#### Identifiers:
- **`ID`:** ID's are unique element identifiers for HTML elements. ID names should only be used once per HTML document.
```html
<h1 id="title">Movie Review Page</h1>
```
ID names cannot have spaces. If your ID name contains multiple words then you can use dashes between the words like this:
```html
<div id="red-box"></div>
```
- **`Class`:** Classes are used to group elements for styling and behavior.
```html
<div class="box"></div>
```
Unlike IDs, you can reuse the same class name throughout the HTML document. The class value can also have spaces like this:
```html
<div class="box red-box"></div>
<div class="box blue-box"></div>
```
### Special Characters and Linking
#### HTML entities: 
An HTML entity, or character reference, is a set of characters used to represent a reserved character in HTML. Examples include the ampersand `&amp;` symbol and the less than symbol `&lt;`.
```html
<p>This is an &lt;img /&gt; element</p>
<!-- The above paragraph reads "This is an <img/> element -->
```
#### Link:
The `link` element is used to link to external resources like stylesheets and site icons. Here is the basic syntax for using the link element for an external CSS file:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./styles.css" />
```
The `rel` attribute is used to specify the relationship between the linked resource and the HTML document. The `href` attribute is used to specify the location of the URL for the external resource.

#### Script:
The `script` element is used to embed executable code.
```html
<body>
  <script>
    alert("Welcome to freeCodeCamp");
  </script>
</body>
```
While you can technically write all of your JavaScript code inside the `script` tags, it is considered best practice to link to an external JavaScript file instead. Here is an example of using the `script` element to link to an external JavaScript file:
```html
<script src="path-to-javascript-file.js"></script>
```
The `src` attribute is used here to specify the location for that external JavaScript file.
