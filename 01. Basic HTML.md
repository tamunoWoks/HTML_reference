## HTML
**HTML** (_HyperText Markup Language_) is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. In clear terms, HTML tells a web browser what content exists on a page and how that content is organized.

### HTML Basics:
- **Role of HTML:** HTML represents the content and structure of the web page.
- **HTML Elements:** Elements are the building blocks for an HTML document. They represent headings, paragraphs, links, images and more. Most HTML elements consist of an opening tag `<elementName>` and a closing tag `</elementName>`.

Here is the basic syntax:
```html
<p>This element represents a paragraph</p>
```
#### Void Elements: 
Void elements in HTML are elements that do not have closing tags and cannot contain any content. They consist of a single tag and are used to insert or represent something in the document rather than wrap content. Below are the most commonly used void elements:
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description">
<br>
<hr>
<input type="text">
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```
It is common to see some codebases that include a forward slash (/) inside the void element. Both of these are acceptable:
```html
<img src="img.png">
<img src="img.png"/>
```
#### Attributes:
An attribute is a value placed inside the opening tag of an HTML element. Attributes provide additional information about the element or specify how the element should behave. Here is the basic syntax for an attribute:
```html
<tagname attribute="value">Content</tagname>
```
Example:
```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="Company logo">
```
- `src` specifies the image source.
- `alt` provides alternative text for accessibility.
